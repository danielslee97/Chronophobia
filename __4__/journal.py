              "The day I did it, a man had ask me to describe the color black"\
              " to him. Until this day, I was never able to answer his "\
              "question. But to the man I once knew, I finally give you your "\
              "answer. \n\n Close your eyes. Plug your ears. Hold your breath"\
              ". Fall in love with somebody. Give them every single inch of "\
              "your body. Give them every beat of your heart. And now imagine"\
              " them gone. Walk into a room. The room is your brain. Keep "\
              "walking until you reach the darkest corner and slide your back"\
              " down the wall. Curl up in fetal position and rub your wet "\
              "face on your knees and remember every single time you've ever "\
              "felt alone. Open your eyes. Look past the sky, look past the "\
              "stars, look past everything you'd ever been shown on a map "\
              "until your vision gets hazy and your focus flattens and you're"\
              " staring into something you're not sure really even exists. "\
              "Stand on the edge of an elevator shaft and feel the echo of "\
              "the small movements your body makes bouncing off the walks "\
              "and vibrating the evidence of your life into the abyss. Pluck"\
              " an eyelash off the cheek of someone you love. Hold it "\
              "between your fingers. Set a warm cup of roasted coffee down on"\
              " a smooth, sleek coffee table. Step foot onto a glossy road, "\
              "slick with rain at night. Feel the hiccup in your chest when "\
              "you miss a step going down the stairs. And after you've done "\
              "all this, Lose the attachment to your senses and fade into "\
              "nothingness. \n\nWhat color do you see?\n------"\
              "\n\n\n\n------LOVE\n"\
              "Love smells like freshly baked bread, clean linen sheets, and "\
              "the warm wet smell of rain in the heat.\nLove tastes like "\
              "powdered sugar, faintly sweet. Like a flaky buttery croissant."\
              " Like a thick dark cup of coffee.\nLove feels like a dive into"\
              " a perfectly temperatured indoor pool, like the stinging heat"\
              " of a warm house after a few hours in the snow (inviting but "\
              "still biting).\nLove feels like the right tongue fitting "\
              "perfectly in your mouth.\nLove sounds like a TV on low in the "\
              "background of a sleeping couple.\nLove sounds like the buzz of"\
              " a periwinkle blue refridgerator light at 3 am.\nLove sounds "\
              "like the slight snore and smacking lips of a sleeping child.\n"\
              "Love looks like the silver light the floods through sheer "\
              " curtains just before the sun rises when it seems like the "\
              "entire world is quiet and revolving around you.\nLove looks "\
              "like round blurry city lights through a wet windshield.\nLove"\
              " looks like skin. Love looks like skin so close you can see "\
              "every pore, every freckle, every pimple, every scar. \n\n"\
              "And damn does it look beautiful.\n------"
